# sylver-coinage
Python code related to the Sylver Coinage game and to numerical semigroups.

Background on Sylver Coinage: http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/15859-s11/notes/sylver-coinage.pdf

Important to note (that I don't think is covered in the PDF): If at any point "you" play, creating a symmetrical numerical semigroup, then assuming both you and your opponent play intelligently from that point, you will lose. So neither player wants to create symmetrical (irreducible, actually) numerical semigroups.

The (so-far) result of a couple of months of on-and-off coding and testing. Most of it was done with varying end goals in mind (ie, "create a program in which you can play Sylver Coinage," "create a program that will generate all possible games from a point in Sylver Coinage," "make a program that will find P-positions."

How to setup/run:<br>
	You will need Python 3 (most parts should be compatible with Python 2.7 or similar, but I haven't tested it.)<br>
	Download all the .py files in the main folder.<br>
	If you are concerned about the .p files being malicious, they (and the trios.txt file) are optional.<br>
	Run AutoPlay.py.<br>
	Profit.<br>
